##### Toronto & San Francisco
## Cycle 1, May 23-June 20, 2016

I don’t want to make rules for myself because I tend to feel more of an impetus to break them if they exist. At the same time I think I am wasting valuable time on things that are easy but without a tangible value. I know I’d like to write professionally in my life but it’s almost the last thing I do when faced with some spare time. So in the spirit of steering my life in the right direction I thought I’d sit down and come up with some guidelines to start from.

**Smoke less, drink less, read more, walk more, and write**.

What is this list saying quantitatively?

---

## Smoke less
Right now I smoke once when I get home and then anywhere from 1 to 5 times more before I go to bed from Monday to Saturday. Not usually more than a half bowl at a time but not less than a quarter either. The past few weeks a little more than usual because I’m living alone until Isobel returns from California. When she is in Toronto I definitely smoke quite a bit less, so this area may correct itself in time. However, I should be more aware of how much I’m smoking and work towards cutbacks — taking a day or two off per week to begin with.

##### Current:
Smoking at least twice daily, from 1 to 3 bowls depending on day of week, feelings, Isobel’s presence, etc.
##### Intent:
No Smoke Tuesdays && reduce throughout rest of the week to 1 joint and joints only for the next while to reduce convenience and anytime access.
##### Method:
For the next 4 weeks I won’t be smoking on Tuesdays and will work towards reducing throughout the week to gauge the impact of the intended behaviour changes.

## Drink Less
I’m not going to drink less at this time, I don’t drink a problem amount currently and I enjoy the relationship I have with alcohol at this point in time.

##### Current:
I drink a few times a week and heavier on weekends. Isobel and I tend to drink more when we’re drinking together. I drink a lot less than I used to and I’m happy with where I am.
##### Intent:
No changes needed.
##### Method:
No method needed.

## Read More
At the beginning of 2016 I had set out to read 26 books over the course of the year assuming an average book length of 400 pages and reading 40 pages or so per day. I haven’t kept that up to this point but I intend to start up this goal again and begin recording progress somehow.

##### Current:
I read more than I have in the past few years but I am not anywhere near the numbers I need to be hitting to reach my goal.
##### Intent:
Stick to original goal of 26 books in one year.
##### Method:
To start this goal back up I’ll stick to the original page count goal and then edge it up in four weeks from now. I’ll also try and figure out how  many I pages/day I need to do to reach the goal by the end of the year.

## Walk More
Now that weather is nicer in Toronto and I have a good rain jacket there is almost no reason why I can’t be walking every day. Google tells me it would take 45 minutes to walk to work so I’ll start with that and work to incorporate a short run in the day as well. The goal while doing these walks is talking with Isobel or story idea generation. Bring a notebook and pen.

##### Current:
I walk a little each day but it’s apparently pretty good for you and I know it makes me feel more creative so I’m going to be doing more of it for the next 4 weeks to see how I like it.
##### Intent:
Walk at least 45 minutes (plus your normal, incidental walking) each day (a walk from home to work is this length)
##### Method:
I will either walk to work in the morning or on the way home or after my workday. I will use this time for story idea generation or giving Isobel attention.

## Write.
Scariest one! I make this goal a lot and I don’t fully follow through on it. This time I will as best I can and I’ll track it somehow — 750words is annoying and unless I can export to it from within this app, I’ll track it on my own. A private Github repo would work pretty well, now that I think about it.

##### Current:
I want to write but I never do it.
##### Intent:
I will write every day and track my progress through a private repository on Github. I will not begin with any minimum word count because I want to focus on one thing — daily writing, daily practice.
##### Method:
Begin a repository on Github for writing, this entry can be the first. Play with some entry formats and find a markdown cheat sheet. Most of all, write every day and be able prove it to yourself in 4 weeks.

## Closing Thoughts
This feels right. It’s based on the honest reality of my current behaviour and sets realistic goals in each of the categories. There are other things I would like to be able to do with my time but I will add and remove items in the future — I don’t think I have the willpower to immediately give up all of my “easy and cheap” indulgences. I’m toying with the idea of playing with an earlier bedtime and waking time in this 4 week cycle. I also may reduce the cycle to two weeks if I want to reevaluate more often.
